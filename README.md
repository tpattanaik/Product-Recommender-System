# Product-Recommender-System

# Abstract:
In today's modern epoch of information technology, the idea of efficiently finding one's favourite product in a large dataset of application database, becomes an essential issue to address for the online content providers in order to attract the masses as opposed to their competitors. Recommender systems or recommendation systems, as they are popularly known, are information filtering systems which are usually integrated with several consumer and commercial applications. Such systems act as a bridge between various content facilitators such as social media websites, e-commerce portals, streaming platforms, etc. and the users of these applications, by suggesting them items from the application database which conform to the user preferences and past activities. Such personalized systems play a vital role, especially when the user is unclear of the item to the searched for. These systems are infiltrating every aspect of our lives, in the form of ?Because you watched? header on Netflix, ?People you may know? section on Facebook, ?Customers who bought this also bought' partition on Amazon.

# Problem Statement:
Many online businesses rely on customer
reviews and ratings. Explicit feedback is
especially important in the ecommerce industry
where all customer engagements are impacted
by these ratings. Amazon relies on such rating
data to power its recommendation engine to
provide the best beauty product
recommendations that are personalized and
most relevant to the user.

Build a recommender engine that reviews the
customer ratings and purchase history to
recommend items and improve sales for beauty
products.
